# portfolio
This project was made as a place to show my past and future work. 
I made it with css and html. I plan on returning to this project with more js and backend experience. 
This project will be used in the future to be shown to future employers and will include more flashy css attributes.
I learned from this project how to use css and how to id and organize html elements to be more efficent for css coding.
